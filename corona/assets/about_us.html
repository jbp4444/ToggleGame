This is a simple game where you have a 3x3 grid of buttons and you
want to turn them all the same color.  But when you press one button,
a random set of neighboring buttons also toggle their state.
<p>
Under the "Settings" screen, you can set the maximum number of 
other buttons that can be toggled.  I.e. setting "Max T" to 2 will
ensure that at most 2 other buttons toggle when you press a button.
<p>
Increasing the "Max T" setting will make the game progressively harder.
